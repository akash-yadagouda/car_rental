# Rent-A-Car

The Rent-A-Car project is based on MEAN Stack that contains 4 different elements - each using JavaScript to run itself:

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) - non-relational database.
- [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) - Node framework to ease usage of server calls.
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) - frontend JS library used to create SPA applicatons.
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/) - server-side JS environment based on V8.

Rent-A-Car app allows user to search through cars available for renting, rent selected car and use online payment handled by DotPay API to authorize and pay for car renting.
Signing up/Logging in is required for app's full experience.

App's default credentials:

1. Login: 'test@test.com', passwd: 'test'.
2. Admin: 'admin@admin.com', passwd: 'admin'.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js and NPM](nodejs.org) >= v0.12.0
- [Bower](bower.io) (`npm install --global bower`)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) and then `gem install sass`
- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) (`npm install --global grunt-cli`)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) - Keep a running daemon with `mongod`

### Developing

1. Run `npm install` to install server dependencies.

2. Run `bower install` to install front-end dependencies.

3. Run `mongod` in a separate shell to keep an instance of the MongoDB Daemon running

4. Run `grunt serve` to start the development server. It should automatically open the client in your browser when ready.

## Build & development

## Testing
